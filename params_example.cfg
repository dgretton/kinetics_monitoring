XOR (1 parity)
Balls assigned to trusted parties
a: 1, 2
b: 2, 3
c: 3, 4
d: 4, 5
e: 5, 6
f: x, 1

x is the parity.

Attacker gets:
a, c, e, reconstructs x
b, d, f, reconstructs 6

Reed-Solomon, 2 parities
Balls assigned to trusted parties
a: 1, 2
b: 2, 3
c: 3, 4
d: 4, 5
e: 5, 6
f: 6, x
g: x, y
h: y, 1

x and y are parities.

Attacker gets:
a, c, e, reconstructs x and y
b, d, f, reconstructs y and 1
